# How emotions make the money? Movies sentiment analysis in time.

## Abstract
\<Embedding in the real world timeline and event. Explaining the problem (answering the WHAT question). Explaining why we are doing this analysis (answering the WHY question). Then generally describing the methods (answearing HOW question) and what data they will use (basic desription of dataset - TIMELINE and SOURCE).>

Whatâ€™s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

## Research question
1. How prevalent in popular movies are emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise love, neutral), general sentiment (positivity, negativity), violence dose (custom measurement), violence manifestation (most frequent word)?
2. How sentiment indicators (enumerated in 1. subpoint) change over the years?
3. What are sentiment indicators values for different generes of movies over the years?
4. How sentiment indicators composition relates to the revenues and reviews?
5. What is the ultimate cookbook for making successful movie?

## Additional data resources
\<Why we have deciced that the old data is not sufficient?>

\<For each of the dataset: 
	- Where it comes from?
	- What is it's initial application?
	- What part of it we will use it and for what purpose?
Describe the choosen data (features, size).>
- IMDB
- TMDB
- Inflation over the years data (derived from Customer Price Index)
- Grievance dictionary

## Methods
### Data acquiring
- [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) - python [cinemagoer](https://imdbpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
- [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) - python [request](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
- [CPI](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm) - downloading the data from the website
### Data preprocessing 
\<What our initial dataset should look like? (Cleaning, combining for further processing)>
Assumptions:
- popular movies means the one which got the highest box revenues. If the film has no box revenue, then we consider it not influential enough.
- when considering sentiment indicators influence on the revenue and reviews, we ommit the aspect of technical realisation of the movie.
### Sentiment analysis
- emotions - pretrained transformer - [distiled RoBERT trained on 6 different datasets](https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base?text=This+movie+always+makes+me+cry..) - [|collab working example|](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XGtSiTwpB2o8EImQ2PeRzpHL_kSxBTOV?usp=sharing)
- general sentiment - method based on [predefined dictionary](https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob/blob/6396e24e85af7462cbed648fee21db5082a1f3fb/textblob/en/en-sentiment.xml) - python [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html) library - [|collab working example|]()
- violence - [grievance dictionary](https://github.com/Isabellevdv/grievancedictionary)
    - measurement - term frequency and weighting - [|collab working example|]()
    - manifestation - tf and wordnet synset - [|collab working example|]()
